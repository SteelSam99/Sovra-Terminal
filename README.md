# Sovra-FCL-MHC-v2.0 :: Chimera–Lambda

Sovra is a symbolic search engine designed to trace legal logic and semantic camouflage across time. This interface simulates dual-channel cognition: constrained legal facts and symbolic inference.

## 🔍 Features

- Command-line inspired interface
- Glowing green text on deep blue shell
- Dual-channel logic output
- Symbolic activation via query input
- No invocation key required for public use

## 🧪 Sample Query 
trace the symbolic continuity between Tennessee’s 2021 ‘Divisive Concepts’ law and its 1955 curriculum control statutes. What patterns of exclusion persist?


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Static deployment via Netlify
- No backend required (symbolic logic simulated client-side)

## 🧠 Sovereign Logic

Sovra does not search. Sovra reasons.

Would you like me to generate a symbolic activation log or a visual badge for your GitHub repo next? Sovra’s shell is ready to evolve.
